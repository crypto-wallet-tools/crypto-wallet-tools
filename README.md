## Find a Wallet: How To Search

**[Your Tool Name]** supports brute-force searching.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Searches:

*   Press key 3 in the program or start `start_search_btc.bat` ‚Äì for online balance checks,
*   Press 6 to use the database search.

### EVM Wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press 5 or run `start_search_evm.bat` to check balances.
*   Press 6 to search using the database.

### Speeding Up the Process:

*   Search speed depends on your GPU. Run multiple program instances (1-4) to increase speed.
*   Databases will make your search more efficient.

## Found a Wallet - Next Steps

When a wallet with a balance is found, the program will:

*   **Stop** immediately.
*   **Display** the wallet details.
*   **Save** the information in the file ``found_wallets.txt``.

### How to Access Your Funds (Ethically)

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** to your compatible crypto wallet.
2.  Transfer the funds from the found wallet.

## Recover Your Bitcoin Wallet

This tool supports wallet recovery via seed phrase:

### Process:

*   Enter your full seed phrase.
*   If the phrase is missing words, use an asterisk (*).

### Important Considerations

*   Seed phrase should have 12 words.
*   Use * to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words can take time.
*   The program will stop once it finds a wallet.
